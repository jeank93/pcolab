## [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bui/remocolab/blob/master/remocolab.ipynb)

A fork of [remocolab](https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab) that ditches SSH support and uses [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) as a viewer instead. Also makes some changes like enabling passwordless sudo, and installing Chromium and Noto fonts.

Instructions are detailed in the [notebook](remocolab.ipynb).
